public class Riviera {
	//Fantasy game
	//2 players, set aside top card for atout suit, 10 cards in each hand, 10 cards in the river visible to each player, reveal atout
	//Each turn, turn top card of deck to add to river, then fish or discard
	//To fish, put down a card from hand with a card in the river with same number or suit, then add both to your bank
	//To discard, add a card from your hand to the river, not adding it to your bank
	//Blanks can fish/be fished with any card
	//When both hands are empty, count scores on each bank (which should have 20 cards each if no discard)
	//Blanks don't count for any score (unless maybe you get 3/4?)
	//Each triple number gets point equal to its number (triple 4 gives 4, triple 12 gives 12), dragon and flower are 12
	//Each quadruple is twice the number (quadruple 4 gives 8...)
	//Each card of the current atout suit gives 2 points
	//If you get 8 of the same suit, 40 points
	//If you get at least one of each number (1..12) 60 points
